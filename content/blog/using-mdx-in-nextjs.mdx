# Using MDX in Next.js

MDX is a powerful combination of Markdown and JSX that allows you to write content with embedded React components.

## Why Use MDX?

MDX provides several benefits for content-heavy websites:

1. **Rich Content** - Embed interactive components within your markdown
2. **Consistent Styling** - Apply your design system to markdown content
3. **Developer Experience** - Write content in a familiar format
4. **Component Reuse** - Create and reuse custom components

## Setting Up MDX in Next.js

First, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react
```

Then, configure your Next.js project to support MDX:

```javascript
// next.config.mjs
import createMDX from '@next/mdx';

const withMDX = createMDX({
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
    rehypePlugins: [],
  },
});

export default withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
});
```

## Using Components in MDX

One of the best features of MDX is the ability to use React components directly in your content:

```jsx
import { Chart } from '../components/Chart';

# Sales Report

Here's our quarterly sales data:

<Chart data={salesData} />
```

## Styling MDX Content

You can style your MDX content using Tailwind's typography plugin:

```jsx
<article className="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert">
  <MDXContent />
</article>
```

## Conclusion

MDX is a fantastic way to create rich, interactive content in your Next.js applications. It combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components.
