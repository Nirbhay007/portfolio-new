# Getting Started with React Hooks

A comprehensive guide to React Hooks and how they can simplify your functional components.

## Introduction

React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to use state and other React features without writing a class. They allow you to "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

## Core Hooks

### useState

The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useEffect

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components:

```jsx
function ProfilePage({ username }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser(username).then(data => setUser(data));
    
    return () => {
      // Cleanup code
    };
  }, [username]); // Only re-run when username changes
  
  if (!user) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  return <h1>{user.name}</h1>;
}
```

### useContext

The `useContext` hook provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually:

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button className={theme}>Themed Button</button>;
}
```

## Custom Hooks

One of the most powerful features of hooks is the ability to create your own custom hooks:

```jsx
function useWindowWidth() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);
  
  return width;
}
```

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a more direct API to React concepts like props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle. They enable you to reuse stateful logic between components and make your code more readable and maintainable.
